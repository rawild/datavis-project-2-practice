     including nursing homes. Members of the Senate and Assembly are working to pass bills to\
      overturn this. At the time of the budget negotiations, he had already issued an executive order that exempted workers from\

      the ownership of these facilities. Right now you cannot sue the owners and operators of these facilities for negligence due to\
      the ways in which they ran the facilities before or during the pandemic. <br><br> In the last five years, Cuomo has gotten over\

      have had to pay for settlements. Those donations are shown below.\

    The Bernie campaign in 2016 was a testing ground for a new kind of politics,\
    one in which corporate donations were not accepted, and the average contribution to the campaign was $27. While some money is crucial\
    to get a campaign going, the act of reaching voters can be done by volunteers, other voters, not by expensive T.V. ads or mailed flyers.\
    In 2018, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez ran with this model and upset the Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives.\
    Julia Salazar ran on this model, plus an expanded refusal to accept donations from real-estate and beat an incumbant to become state Senator. \
    In 2019, Tiffany Cab√°n ran for District Attorney\
    in Queens with this model and came within 55 votes of winning a campaign in which her opponent \
